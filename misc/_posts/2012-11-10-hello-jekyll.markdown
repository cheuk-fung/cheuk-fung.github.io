excerpt: My first jekyll site.

Finally, I set up my first [Jekyll][] site on [GitHub Pages][] after a
few hours hacking on [Mark Reid][]'s wonderful design. I hope that I
didn't forget anything that should be modified :-)

[Jekyll]: https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/
[GitHub Pages]: http://pages.github.com
[Mark Reid]: http://mark.reid.name

The major modifications I made were the support of [MathJax][] and the
reorganization of layouts which makes it easier to create new
categories. All codes of this site are available [here][].

Enjoy ;-)
