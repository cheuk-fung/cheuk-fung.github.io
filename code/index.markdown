[ACM](https://github.com/leewings/ACM)
:   Codes of problems I solved in [POJ][], [ZOJ][], [SGU][], [HDOJ][]
    and [NKOJ][] to practise my algorithm design skill and prepare for
    [ACM-ICPC](http://icpc.baylor.edu/).

    Additionally, a collection of codes of specific algorithms and data
    structures is available under [Templates](https://github.com/leewings/ACM/tree/master/Templates).
